### Project Description: API Tester VS Code Extension

The **API Tester** is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to streamline the process of testing RESTful APIs directly from the code editor. With a user-friendly interface, it allows developers to send requests, manage headers, and view responses all in one place, enhancing productivity and simplifying API interactions.

#### Key Features:

1. **Send HTTP Requests**: Easily configure and send GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to specified APIs with custom URLs, endpoints, and request bodies.

2. **Dynamic Header Management**: Add, edit, or remove HTTP headers as needed for each request, making it simple to handle authentication tokens, content types, and other necessary metadata.

3. **JSON Validation**: Automatically validate JSON input for POST and PUT requests, providing instant feedback if the format is incorrect.

4. **Error Handling**: Receive detailed error messages for failed requests, including server response statuses and network errors, aiding in troubleshooting.

5. **Request History**: Save frequently used API requests and load them easily for quick access, streamlining repetitive testing workflows.

6. **Loading Indicator**: A visual indicator displays when a request is being processed, enhancing user experience and clarity during operations.

7. **Responsive Design**: The extension is built with a responsive layout, ensuring it works well on various screen sizes and is accessible for all users.

#### Use Cases:

- **API Development**: Perfect for developers creating and testing APIs, enabling them to debug and refine endpoints quickly.
- **Integration Testing**: Facilitates the testing of third-party APIs during application integration, ensuring compatibility and functionality.
- **Learning and Experimentation**: Ideal for learners and educators exploring RESTful APIs, offering a hands-on approach to understanding HTTP requests and responses.

#### Technologies Used:

- **TypeScript**: For building the extension, providing type safety and improved maintainability.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests, simplifying the interaction with RESTful APIs.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating the user interface of the webview, ensuring a smooth user experience.

This extension aims to empower developers by providing a powerful yet simple tool for API testing, directly within their development environment, making it an essential addition to any developer's toolkit.
